Running the Application: If you encounter issues running the application from the IDE, try executing it from the terminal with the appropriate JavaFX module path as described in the "Running the Application" section of this README.
Known Issues

Input Validation: The application currently does not validate non-numeric inputs. Entering letters or special characters may cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. Future updates will include input validation to improve user experience.
Division by Zero: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the application displays an error message ("Error: Division by Zero") but does not reset the input fields. Users must manually clear the fields to start a new calculation.
Large Numbers: The application may not handle very large numbers accurately due to precision limitations. Users should be cautious with extreme values, especially during division operations.
